In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution\nresembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and\nsolutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane.\nc. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and\nperitoneal dialysis (discussed below).\nd. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at\nhospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic\nambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).\ne. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal\nreplacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also\navoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which\nhemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle.\n",

It is thought that up to half of all men in the United States between the ages of 40\nand 70 have some form of erectile dysfunction. Prevalence increases with age.\n3. Pathophysiology\u2014once thought to be psychogenic in origin, it is now known that\nmost cases (80%) are organic. A normal erection is largely dependent on the\nhealthy penile and systemic vasculature.\n4. Some cases of erectile dysfunction are psychogenic.\n",

Laboratory tests\u2014obtain a CBC, chemistry panel, fasting glucose, and lipid\nprofile. If there is hypogonadism or loss of libido, order serum testosterone,\nprolactin levels, and thyroid profile.\n3. Nocturnal penile tumescence\u2014if normal erections occur during sleep, a\npsychogenic cause is likely. If not, the cause is probably organic.\n4. Consider vascular testing\u2014evaluate arterial inflow and venous trapping of blood.\nTests include intracavernosal injection of vasoactive substances, duplex\nultrasound, and arteriography.\n5. Psychological testing may be appropriate in some cases.\n"
