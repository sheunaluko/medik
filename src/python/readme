Hi ! 

Welcome to the python code for medik... one quick note: 
There are two main  prerequisites to running the python scripts: 
	1) The datacommons library needs to be installed
	2) the DC_API_KEY environment variable needs to be set to the appropriate key (see drive folder 'Shared Notes' for key and instructions) 


To test that things are working, ensure the environment is configured as above and then run 'python simple_dc_query.py'
The command should result in 3 cities being output. You can look at the source code to see how Data Commons can be queried 
using SPARQL queries. 

Note: The DC_API_KEY was obtained from the Google Cloud Console. It seems that to use Data Commons you must first have a Google Console Project and API Key, and 
that even the project has to have billing enabled. I created all of the above for the medik team and the credentials and associated accounts are described in the 'Shared Notes' document
