Just initialized a new repo for the medik collaboration. 

Right now this repo is quite empty, but it will soon house all of the core medik software. 

This includes, the client (web) application and the backend for answering queries. 



[solved] It seems I cannot easily compile the typescript sources because they have dependencies from the vcs 
project 
	- just had to 'yarn add uuid' in the medik/ directory 






HOW TO: 

-- [compile typescript src]  

simply run "tsc" in the src directory. This works because there is a .tsconfig file.
Thus if you add a new src directory you must update .tsconfig file 

You can have REACTIVE compilation with a watcher by running the watch_build file 
as well :) 



-- [do x, y, z...]
