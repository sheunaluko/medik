TODO: 

[ ] Agree on communication protocal between the client and backend, so that the work can be split up early 
	- Client can connect to hyperloop ip:port and we could define an API for diagnostic queries 
		-i.e. { symptoms: [ "cough" ] , pmh : ["obesity" ]  , rf : ["smoker" ]  } 
	- [ ] Implement medik/bin/backend.js  
		-will provide hyperloop function and server to answer above queries. 






[solved] It seems I cannot easily compile the typescript sources because they have dependencies from the vcs 
project 
	- just had to 'yarn add uuid' in the medik/ directory
